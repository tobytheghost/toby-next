## Introduction

In this article we are going to explore how to create a component with a 3D starfield type effect similar to the one on the <Link href="/"><a href="/" target="_blank">homepage</a></Link> using <a href="https://reactjs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">React</a> and <a href="https://threejs.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Three.js</a>.

Below is a demo of what we'll be building:

**Demo:**

<StarsDemo1 />

## Setting up the basic component

Before we get started on the component we'll need to install a few packages. The packages we'll be using are `three`, `react-three-fiber` and `@react-three/drei`.

- `three` (Three.js) is an easy to use, lightweight, 3D library with a default WebGL renderer.

- `react-three-fiber` is a React renderer for Three.js.

- `@react-three/drei` (originally just `drei`) is a collection of useful helpers and abstractions for `react-three-fiber`.

We can install these packages as follows:

```bash
npm install three react-three-fiber @react-three/drei
```

Once the packages have been installed we're ready to create our component.

We'll start off with a basic **React functional component** and import the modules we need.

Then we need to include the `Stars` element from `@react-three/drei` and wrap it in the `Canvas` element from `react-three-fiber`.

**Code:**

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Canvas } from "react-three-fiber";
import { Stars } from "@react-three/drei";

const Starfield = () => {
  return (
    <div className="stars">
      <Canvas>
        <Stars />
      </Canvas>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Starfield;
```

This provides us with a very basic version of the starfield effect we are looking for.

**Demo:**

<StarsDemo2 />

> **Note:** For the sake of the demo, we've also add a background, height & margin so that the element is visible.

## Animating the component

Next we need to look at how we can animate the component.

Let's setup a new functional component called `RotatingStars` to return the `Stars` component we imported earlier, and use it to replace the `Stars` component wrapped in the `Canvas`.

**Code:**

```jsx
import React from "react";
import { Canvas } from "react-three-fiber";
import { Stars } from "@react-three/drei";

const RotatingStars = () => {
  return <Stars />;
};

const Starfield = () => {
  return (
    <div className="stars">
      <Canvas>
        <RotatingStars />
      </Canvas>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Starfield;
```

Now that `Stars` is wrapped in it's own component, we are able to manipulate that element.

The `useFrame` hook provided by `react-three-fiber` will allow us to hook the component into the render-loop.

We will also need a way of letting React know which element we'll be animating so we'll need to import the `useRef` hook.

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from "react";
import { Canvas, useFrame } from "react-three-fiber";
import { Stars } from "@react-three/drei";
```

In our `RotatingStars` function, let's create a ref and attach it to the `Stars` component.

```jsx
const RotatingStars = () => {
  const stars = useRef();

  return <Stars ref={stars} />;
};
```

Now we have a reference to the element we can update its rotation on each render of the render-loop using the `useFrame` hook.

```jsx
const RotatingStars = () => {
  const stars = useRef();

  useFrame(() => {
    stars.current.rotation.x = stars.current.rotation.y += 0.00015;
  });

  return <Stars ref={stars} />;
};
```

Here we've set the `x` rotation to be slightly offset from the `y` rotation - giving us the slow spinning effect.

You should now have something that looks like this:

**Code:**

```jsx
import React, { useRef } from "react";
import { Canvas, useFrame } from "react-three-fiber";
import { Stars } from "@react-three/drei";

const Starfield = () => {
  const RotatingStars = () => {
    const stars = useRef();

    useFrame(() => {
      stars.current.rotation.x = stars.current.rotation.y += 0.00015;
    });

    return <Stars ref={stars} />;
  };

  return (
    <div className="stars">
      <Canvas>
        <RotatingStars />
      </Canvas>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Starfield;
```

**Demo:**

<StarsDemo3 />

## Movement Controls

On the version on the homepage there is a button to allow a '3D orbit' type effect. This can be achieved using `OrbitControls` component included in the `@react-three/drei` package.

It's simply a matter of importing the component and wrapping it within the `Canvas` component.

```js
import { Stars, OrbitControls } from "@react-three/drei";
```

```js
return (
  <div className="stars">
    <Canvas>
      <OrbitControls />
      <RotatingStars />
    </Canvas>
  </div>
);
```

This gives us the orbit controls as shown in the demo below:

**Demo:**

<StarsDemo1 />

> **Note:** The '3D' button on the homepage toggles an `orbit` state which in turn toggles the `OrbitControls` component on and off.

## Conclusion

Hopefully this article has given you a brief understanding of how to setup a very basic `react-three-fiber` component while also creating a fun effect that you can use in your projects.
